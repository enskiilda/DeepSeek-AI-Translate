14:29:14.130 (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
14:29:14.130 - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
14:29:14.130 - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
14:29:14.130 - Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.[39m
